## Set up

#### Preliminaries

* The course assumes that the student is familiar with linear models (LMs), generalised linear models (GLMs), and generalised linear mixed models (GLMMs). 
* You can refer to my introduction to LMs, GLMs, and GLMMs with R to familiarise yourself.
* There will be a short overview of LMs, GLMs and GLMMs in the first lecture.



### General Introduction

* LMs, GLMs and GLMMs and why model-based geostatistics.
* Types of spatial data and how model-based geostatistics is different from 
  other spatial statistics disciplines.
* Geostatistical problems and examples


### Spatial exploratory analysis

* Data summaries and visualisation 
* Exploring spatial correlation: the variogram
* Testing the assumption of independence
* Materials: Slides, handout, data, lab session, challenge, video


### The linear geostatistical model (1)

* Model formulation 
* Estimation  
* Spatial prediction.
* Materials: Slides, handout, data, lab session, challenge, video.


### The generalised linear geostatistical model (GLGM)
* GLGMs.
* Binomial geo-statistical models for prevalence mapping
- Formulation
- Estimation
- Spatial prediction
* Poisson geo-statistical models for count data
- Formulation
- Estimation
- Spatial prediction
* Materials: Slides, handout, data, lab session, challenge, video.

## Software Setup

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: discussion

### Details

Setup for different systems can be presented in dropdown menus via a `solution`
tag. They will join to this discussion block, so you can give a general overview
of the software used in this lesson here and fill out the individual operating
systems (and potentially add more, e.g. online setup) in the solutions blocks.
