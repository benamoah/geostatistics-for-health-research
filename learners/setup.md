## Schedule and materials

### Preliminaries

* The course assumes that the student is familiar with linear models (LMs), generalised linear models (GLMs), and generalised linear mixed models (GLMMs). 
* You can refer to my introduction to LMs, GLMs, and GLMMs with R to familiarise yourself.
* There will be a short overview of LMs, GLMs and GLMMs in the first lecture.



### General introduction

* LMs, GLMs and GLMMs and why model-based geostatistics.
* Types of spatial data and how model-based geostatistics is different from 
  other spatial analyses
* Geostatistical problems and examples
* Materials: Slides, data, lab session, challenge, handout, video. 
  You can download  the [data zip file](data/data.zip) for all the materials 
  for this session.



### Spatial exploratory analysis

* Data summaries and visualisation 
* Exploring spatial correlation: the variogram
* Testing the assumption of independence
* Materials: Slides, data, lab session, challenge, handout, video


### The linear geostatistical model

* Model formulation 
* Estimation  
* Spatial prediction.
* Materials: Slides, data, lab session, challenge, handout, video


### The generalised linear geostatistical model (GLGM)

* Introduction to GLGMs
* Binomial geostatistical models for prevalence mapping
  + Formulation
  + Estimation
  + Spatial prediction
* Poisson geostatistical models for count data
  + Formulation
  + Estimation
  + Spatial prediction
* Materials: Slides, data, lab session, challenge, handout, video







## Software Setup

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: discussion

### Details

Setup for different systems can be presented in dropdown menus via a `solution`
tag. They will join to this discussion block, so you can give a general overview
of the software used in this lesson here and fill out the individual operating
systems (and potentially add more, e.g. online setup) in the solutions blocks.
