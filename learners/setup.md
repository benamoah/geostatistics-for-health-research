## Set up

#### Preliminaries

* The course assumes that the student is familiar with linear models (LMs), generalised linear models (GLMs), and generalised linear mixed models (GLMMs). 

* You can refer to my introduction to LMs, GLMs, and GLMMs with R to familiarise yourself.

* There will be a short overview of LMs, GLMs and GLMMs in the first lecture.



#### General Introduction

This session will deal with

* LMs, GLMs and GLMMs and why model-based geostatistics.
* Types of spatial data and what is model-based geostatistics.
* Geostatistical problems and examples
* Materials: Slides, handout, data, lab session, challenge, video.


### The linear geostatistical model
* Spatial exploratory analysis and the variogram.
* The linear geostatistical model: formulation and estimation.
* The linear geostatistical model: spatial prediction.
* Materials: Slides, handout, data, lab session, challenge, video.


### The generalised linear geostatistical model (GLGM)
* Spatial exploratory analysis and the variogram.
* The linear geostatistical model: formulation and estimation.
* The linear geostatistical model: spatial prediction.
* Materials: Slides, handout, data, lab session, challenge, video.

## Software Setup

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: discussion

### Details

Setup for different systems can be presented in dropdown menus via a `solution`
tag. They will join to this discussion block, so you can give a general overview
of the software used in this lesson here and fill out the individual operating
systems (and potentially add more, e.g. online setup) in the solutions blocks.
